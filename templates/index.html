<h1><center>How to sell gift cards on Paxful without getting <b>Ripped</b></center></h1>
 <h5><marquee>Welcome to my blog</marquee></h5>
<p>Have you sold a gift card on Paxful and you got scammed? Do you want tips that will help identify <b>scammer vendors,</b> If yes, worry less because we got you now. We know the pain that comes with getting gift cards from your white head, and you get ripped trying to trade the card.</p>
  <p>The most frustrating part is that when you raise a dispute, you never get awarded the coin the bitcoin seller has higher chances than you especially when there are no concrete evidence to support your claim, so its really hard to win a dispute.</p>
  <p>The purpose of this site is to create awareness on how hustling niggas can sell their cards on paxful without getting ripped off their sweat. You think that's possible?? Yes it is 100% possible</p>
  <p>The normal procedure that you have been going through before you sell card to a vendor (by checking their profile for negative feedback) does not really work again. The vendors (the one's that scammers) are now very much smarter this days. All they need to need to do is block the trader before the dispute is awarded, in that way, the trader won't be able to leave any negetive feedback again making their pofile looks clean</p>
  <p>I know you might you might be imagining, what should i check for in their profile? What you need to check in their profile is the amount of people they've blocked and the ones that have blocked the vendor. And also check for the amount of trades that the vendor has done. Now you need to compare it with the amount of people that have blocked. </p>
